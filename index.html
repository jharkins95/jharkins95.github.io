      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>I graduated in May 2018 with a bachelor's degree in <a href="https://cmpe.seas.upenn.edu/">computer engineering</a> from the University of Pennsylvania. Currently, I work as a teaching assistant for ESE 680: F1/10 Autonomous Racing, a new course at Penn that focuses on developing and using algorithms for one-tenth scale autonomous racing cars.</p>
      <p>I am always open to pursuing new and exciting opportunities, both as part of my career and for fun. My interests include embedded systems, operating systems, firmware development, and software development in general. </p>
