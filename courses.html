Then, we describe data structures like stacks, queues, maps, trees, and graphs, and we construct efficient algorithms based on these representations. The course builds upon existing implementations of basic data structures in Java and extends them for the structures like trees, studying the performance of operations on such structures, and their efficiency when used in real-world applications. A large project introducing students to the challenges of software engineering concludes the course.</p>
