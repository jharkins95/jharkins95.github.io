      <p>Who thought engineering school was just about reading lengthy textbooks and studying for exams?</p>
      <p>As an aspiring engineer, I am happy to share with you several projects I have undertaken during my time at Penn. 
      
      <h2>Research Projects</h2>
        
      <h3>Pressure-Sensitive Yoga Mat</h3>
      <h4>Advisor: Dr. Rahul Mangharam, Professor, ESE</h4>
      <h4>Partners: Kevin Volkel, Dr. Marco Beccani</h4>
      <p>This is a summer research project that I undertook in <a href="https://mlab.seas.upenn.edu/">mLab</a>, an embedded systems research lab at Penn.</p>
        <p>The goal was to design a 12-by-12 inch fabric mat capable of reading the pressure exerted on individual elements and lighting electroluminescent panels according to the pressure applied.</p>
	  <p>I designed the system hardware architecture, which included selecting components and creating the PCB layouts for both the power supply and the sensor reading/amplification circuitry.
	      I also implemented the software for reading the pressure data and controlling the lights' brightness.</p>

      <p>A user-level operating system featuring a round-robin priority scheduler, FAT file system, and bash-inspired shell.</p>

      <h3>Semester Planning App - CIS 350</h3>
      <p>An Android app that allows users to plan and schedule school-related activities, including homework assignments and quizzes.</p>
	      
      <h3>EasyBoard: A Smart Breadboard - ESE 350</h3>
      <h4>Partner: Bill He</h4>
